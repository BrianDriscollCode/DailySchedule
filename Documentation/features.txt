Daily schedule app

1. Enter in task and time (am/pm) - CHECK
2. Tasks color coded by type

Ordering list on times

Now the arrays dynamically adjust based on table. Time to sort the table based
on time values.

PRIORITY - Create objects to use for printing and reordering the list

1. Need to determine value based on start time
  A. Extract the starting time value (with am or pm)
  B. Determine the schedule time value based off the string (ex: 3am, 6am, 7pm, etc)
  C. Write basic algorithm to rearrange based off ranked values.
  D. Reprint these values corresponding with new positions.
2. Sort array based on those values.


***BIG FIX - FIX UPDATING THE FINALLIST ARRAY - Still doesn't delete right element***

Delete button doesn't update correctly but when entering new element, list updates
accordingly.
